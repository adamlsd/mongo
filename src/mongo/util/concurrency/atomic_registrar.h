/**
 * The AtomicRegistrar provides a threadsafe touchpoint for tracking registrations and
 * deregistrations of elements from a tracking set.  Its usecases can include connection tracking,
 * user-session tracking, limited resource tracking, and child-thread tracking.
 *
 * The `AtomicRegistrar` stores multiple objects in a threadsafe manner and returns a lightweight
 * "ticket" to allow for tracking and management.  These tickets are somewhat like pointers or
 * iterators; they do not expire before the Registrar expires, nor do they get invalidated by any
 * mutating operations on the Registrar.
 *
 * In some sense the `AtomicRegistrar` can be thought of like a coat-check with claim-tickets.  A
 * coat is given at the checkin desk, and a claim ticket is presented, representing the coat in the
 * coat check.  At the end of an event, when a coat check is closed, all coats are divested.  During
 * the event, coat owners may present claim-tickets to retrieve their coats when they wish to
 * depart.  This registrar interface tracks elements in much the same way, and it is threadsafe.
 *
 * Sample Usecase
 * --------------
 * ~~~
 * class Networking {
 * private:
 *     using ConnectionRegistrar = AtomicRegistrar<std::shared_ptr<std::iostream>>;
 *
 * public:
 *     struct Socket {
 *         ConnectionRegistrar::Ticket registration;
 *         std::iostream* socket;
 *     }
 *
 *     // Acquire a connection -- the Networking class owns the connections.
 *     Socket
 *     startSession(const ServerAddress& target) {
 *         std::unique_ptr<std::iostream> socket = openConnection(target);
 *         auto socket_ptr = socket.get() auto ticket = connections.enroll(std::move(socket));
 *         return Socket{ticket, socket_ptr};
 *     }
 *
 *     // Manually close a connection.
 *     void closeSession(const Socket& socket) {
 *         connections.retire(socket.ticket);
 *     }
 *
 *     // Print statistics about presently opened connections.
 *     void printStatistics() const {
 *         for (const auto& connection : connections.snapshot()) {
 *             std::cerr << statistics(connection) << std::endl;
 *         }
 *     }
 *
 * private:
 *     ConnectionRegistrar connections;
 * };
 *
 * // ...
 *
 * int main() {
 *     Networking network;
 *
 *     while (true) {
 *         Socket s = network.startSession({"someserver.com", 4242});
 *
 *         // Start session thread
 *         std::thread([s] {
 *             while (true) {
 *                 // ...
 *
 *                 // In case of error, close our session and terminate.
 *                 if (s.error()) {
 *                     network.closeSession(s);
 *                     break;
 *                 }
 *             }
 *         });
 *
 *         network.printStatistics();
 *     }
 *
 *     closeBackgroundThreads();
